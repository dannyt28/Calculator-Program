      <b>The 7 functions/operator switch cases are written such as multipulcation, divison, subtraction. Furthermore, switch case 'h' displays the available options, 'c' will clear the screen, and 'Q' will exit the program. </b>

      <b>Code that is written here is what the user will see (printf). Further down, the scanf_s is the command that will scan the 2 numbers that are requested of the user when using the addition operator. </b>

    <p>
      <b>The results are returned to the user and then the code is pretty much repeated for the different operators, subtraction and multipulcation. Line 137, "scanf_s" is where the changes are made for subtraction and so on. </b>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Performing live system forensics requires precision to avoid losing crucial evidence. In this project, industry-standard forensic recovery tools were utilized to conduct a live system memory analysis. The investigation involved capturing a live image of the host system's RAM using AccessData FTK Imager on a Windows 10 VM and analyzing the captured memory image using Volatility on a SIFT VM. The focus of the investigation encompassed the examination of operating system processes, registries, log files, and hashes. Detailed methodology and findings were meticulously documented in a comprehensive Microsoft Word report, including step-by-step screen captures. The report serves as complete forensic lab notes, establishing the investigator's expertise as a potential witness in court proceedings, if required.
